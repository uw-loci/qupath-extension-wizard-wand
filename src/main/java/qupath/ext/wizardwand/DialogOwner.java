/**
 * Attaches dialogs to the QuPath main window so they cannot hide behind it.
 *
 * <p>A JavaFX {@link javafx.scene.control.Alert} is {@code APPLICATION_MODAL} by default, so it
 * blocks input to every window in the application. An unowned modal dialog is not tied to any
 * stage, so nothing keeps it in front of the QuPath window; when QuPath takes focus the dialog
 * can end up behind it, and the application then accepts no input with nothing visible to
 * explain why. Giving the dialog an owner fixes it: an owned window always stays above its
 * owner.
 *
 * <p>Same helper as {@code qupath.ext.qpsc.ui.DialogOwner}; keep the copies in step.
